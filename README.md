SynSaveInstance++

SynSaveInstance++ is a high-performance graphical wrapper for the Universal SSI core. It provides a professional interface to manage complex place-saving parameters without manually editing script configurations.

Main Features:

    Full SSI Core Support: Includes Terrain data and Raw properties capture.

    Advanced Decompiler Control: Adjustable timeouts up to 300 seconds for complex environments.

    Optimized for Large Maps: Built-in settings to handle massive places (Forsaken-ready).

    Bilingual Interface: Toggle between English and Russian languages instantly.

    Modular Architecture: Separate GUI and Core logic for maximum stability and speed.

Execution:

To run the utility, use the following loadstring in your executor:
Lua

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SynSaveInstance-Plus-Plus/main/main.lua"))()

Information:
The utility automatically fetches the latest core logic and allows real-time switching between capture modes (Full, Scripts, or Objects). All output files are saved to your exploit's workspace folder in .rbxl format.
